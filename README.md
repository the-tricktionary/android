# the-tricktionary Android app

The sport of competitive jump roping is a continually growing international community of some of the world's most talented athletes. This app aims to help anyone hoping to become involved in this phenomenal sport by giving anyone with a phone the knowledge needed to learn all levels and types of jump rope skills. 

The Tricktionary is organized by type (Basics, Multiples, Power, Rope Manipulation, and Releases) and by level (1-5). It provides a description, a video, prerequisites, and what to learn next for each trick.

It also includes a speed counter, show writer, and profile system to keep track of tricks and share them with your friends.
